# Project Overview
Welcome to MunicipalAI's Computer Vision project! This project focuses on Community issue computer vision tasks using multiple models. In this readme, you will find essential information about the project, its objectives, and how to get started.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

Data Transparency:  Allows anyone to view the data used to train the models.

Algorithm Transparency:  Allows anyone to view the models and approach used to train.

Feedback: If a mistake was made the community may correct and improve.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

    models/: model types
    
        instance/: a directory of each model
        
            model/: files needed to train model

## Installation
Before you can run the project, you need to set up your environment.  In each of the model folders there is a readme and setup.sh script.  In the readme is the docker image we used on https://vast.ai . Once you have launched the docker image you can run the command included in the readme.

## Training Models: 
The setup.sh script in each model folder will launch the training.

## Documentation: 
Maintain up-to-date documentation for each model in the corresponding model directory within models/. Include information on model architecture, training history, and usage instructions.
